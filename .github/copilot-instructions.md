# Momentum agent instructions

## Hard rule
- Never commit or push changes.

## Command execution
- Use Poetry-first Python commands (`poetry run ...`) for linting, typing, tests, scripts, and app entry points.

## Cross-surface settings parity
- Desktop UI settings and mobile app settings must stay behaviorally aligned.
- Any setting added, removed, renamed, or changed on one surface must be reviewed and updated on the other surface in the same change unless the user explicitly asks for a temporary exception.
- Treat settings parity as applying to both persistence and visible UI behavior: labels, defaults, effects, and runtime application should match across desktop and mobile.

## Mobile UI learnings
- On Android/Kivy accordion-style sections, collapsed children must also shrink to zero height and be disabled; hiding only the parent container is not sufficient to keep touch behavior reliable.
- Keep passive encouragement or status copy in a stable always-visible area near the bottom of the home screen rather than burying it inside a collapsible section.
- Show ACT-specific controls only when the assessment-derived support threshold says they are needed; otherwise remove the affordance entirely instead of showing a disabled tease.
