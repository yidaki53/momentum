# The Science Behind Momentum

## Executive Dysfunction and Depression

Depression is reliably associated with impairments in executive function -- the mental processes responsible for planning, initiating, and completing goal-directed activities. A large meta-analysis of 113 studies found effect sizes of d=0.32-0.97 across multiple executive domains (inhibition, shifting, working memory, planning, and fluency). These deficits are linked to reduced prefrontal cortex activity, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is critical for organising behaviour toward goals. Fatigue and energy loss appear to be the primary depression symptoms bridging mood and executive impairment, which is why even simple tasks can feel insurmountable.

## How Momentum Helps: Behavioural Activation

Momentum's core design -- breaking tasks into small manageable steps, scheduling activities, and tracking completion -- is grounded in Behavioural Activation (BA), one of the most well-supported psychological treatments for depression. BA works by reversing the vicious cycle of inactivity and low mood: when depression leads to withdrawal, the loss of positive reinforcement deepens the depression further. By encouraging small, achievable actions, BA restores a sense of mastery and pleasure. A meta-analysis of 20 randomised controlled trials found BA produced a pooled effect size of g=0.52 on well-being, comparable to other leading psychological interventions.

## Focus Timers and Structured Work

Momentum's 15-minute focus timer draws on the principles behind the Pomodoro Technique, which structures work into focused intervals followed by short breaks. Research with 87 university students found that students taking systematic timed breaks reported lower fatigue, less distractedness, and higher concentration and motivation compared to those who self-regulated their breaks. For people with executive dysfunction, this external structure is especially valuable -- it removes the cognitive burden of deciding when to work and when to rest, effectively offloading an executive function that depression impairs.

## Gentle Encouragement and Self-Compassion

Momentum's encouragement messages reflect the principles of self-compassion -- treating yourself with kindness during difficulty rather than self-criticism. A meta-analysis of 56 randomised controlled trials found that self-compassion interventions produced moderate reductions in depressive symptoms (g=0.66) and anxiety (g=0.57). Crucially, self-compassion has been shown to increase behavioural activation: people who are kinder to themselves after setbacks are more motivated to try again, creating a positive feedback loop with task completion.

## Nature Imagery and Mood

The peaceful nature images Momentum displays at launch are not merely decorative. Viewing images of natural environments has been shown to increase feelings of comfort and relaxation with a large effect size, while reducing activity in the orbitofrontal cortex -- a brain region that is hyperactive in depression and anxiety. Importantly, people with more depressive symptoms benefit more from viewing nature than those without, making this a particularly fitting intervention for Momentum's users.

## A Note

Momentum is a supportive tool, not a replacement for professional treatment. If you are experiencing depression, please reach out to a healthcare provider. The strategies in this app are drawn from evidence-based approaches, but they work best as part of a broader support system.
